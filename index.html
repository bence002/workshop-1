        <h1>UX training daily schedule</h1>
        <p>During the three-day training, we teach you UX design processes as well as research methods. Prototyping and user testing with a design software are also part of this training.
        <br>Eventually, you wil be able to lead your own UX project.</p>
        
        <h2>Day 1 - Back to the basics!</h2>
        <p>The first day involves acquiring a basic knowledge of the UX approach and methods. In this spirit, we look at the product design process stages.</p>
        <p>We discuss the basics of user research, interview and test planning, user personas and journeys. Then come the concepts of the jobs to be done and value proposition, along with goal-setting and process planning.</p>

        <p>Finally, we teach you how to create a product prototype, first on a paper and later on with the help of a prototyping software.</p>

        <h1>Why should you learn offline instead of online?</h1>
        <p>Usability is the key to a great customer experience. As a UX company, this is our number one priority. Mid and large-sized companies can greatly benefit from an external team’s view on current processes and tasks. UX experts can provide additional insights on how to improve your product's design and performance.</p>
